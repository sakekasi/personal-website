			<p>
				I'm currently an undergraduate CS major at <a href="http://www.ucla.edu" target="_blank">UCLA</a> and I enjoy creating things via the medium of software. I take pride in seeing my creations running in front of me, and enjoy writing clean, simple code that can speak for itself.

			<p>
				I have interned at <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/" target="_blank">Qualcomm</a> in San Diego, and a startup in Santa Monica called <a href="http://atthepool.com/" target="_blank">'At the Pool,'</a> which focuses on crowdsourcing the dissemination of local knowledge. I am currently freelancing, and create websites for doctors.

			<p>
				Within computer science, I have enjoyed learning about the design decisions involved in the semantics and grammar of programming languages, as well as about the algorithms and ideas involved in artificial intelligence.

				Along with programming, I also enjoy exploring creation via the arts and design. I have played the clarinet for seven years and have been a part of various musical groups around UCLA. Recently, I have begun exploring visual art through procedural and generative art, as well as graphic design.
