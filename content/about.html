I'm currently an undergraduate CS major at <a href="http://www.ucla.edu" target="_blank">UCLA</a>, and I enjoy creating things via the medium of software. I take pride in seeing my creations running in front of me, and enjoy writing clean, simple code that can speak for itself.

Over the course of my college career, I have had the opportunity to gain broad experience with a variety of different members of the computing industry. I have interned at large companies such as <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/" target="_blank">Qualcomm</a> in San Diego and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank">Bloomberg LP</a> in New York City;
at a startup in Santa Monica called <a href="http://www.yeti.ai/" target="_blank">&lsquo;Yeti,&rsquo;</a> which focuses on crowdsourcing the dissemination of local knowledge; and have done some freelance work, creating websites for real estate agents with a partner. Currently, I am doing research with the Communications Design Group (CDG) in order to explore
how people will program in the future.

Within the field of Computer Science, I have enjoyed learning about the design decisions involved in the semantics and grammar of programming languages. I also enjoy the study of computing theory, and the algorithms and ideas involved in artificial intelligence.

Outside of Computer Science, I also enjoy learning about the arts and design. I have played the clarinet for seven years and have been a part of various musical groups around UCLA. More recently, I have begun exploring visual art through programs which procedurally generate visuals, learning about graphic design, and through self-study in the field of Human Computer Interaction.
