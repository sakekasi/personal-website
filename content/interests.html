		UCLA Bruin Marching Band (Clarinet)
	</a>
	<p>
		As a member of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band, I play at football games, basketball games and any other sporting events to support UCLA. I have performed at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA for several UCLA home games (including our 38-28 win against USC) , at California Memorial Stadium at UC Berkeley, at Stanford Stadium for the 2012 PAC-12 Championship game, and at Qualcomm stadium in San Diego for the Bridgepoint Education Holiday Bowl in January of 2013.

		UCLA Woodwind Ensemble (Clarinet)
	</a>
	<p>
		In Woodwind Ensemble, I perform in a small group with music and non-music majors to prepare a new piece each quarter with advice and direction from professor Gary Gray. In the last year, I have been a part of a duet, a trio, and a quartet, and performed various classical pieces in UCLA's Jan Popper Theater.
